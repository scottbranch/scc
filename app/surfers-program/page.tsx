                  Children in this program are planning on attending
                  Kindergarten in the Fall of 2023. Our SCC Surfers spend this
                  foundational year exploring the world of letter and number
                  mastery, Alpha Friends Phonics Program, Bible words and Bible
                  law memorization, word families, sight words, Scholastic
                  Reading Program, and Journal Writing Program. This is the year
                  reading and writing takes off, good choices are the "norm",
                  the seeds of the Holy Spirit are planted, and we see
                  transformations happen before our eyes. SCC Surfers leave this
                  program thoroughly prepared academically, emotionally,
                  socially, and spiritually for the next step to elementary
                  school.
